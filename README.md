# SurrogateModelling

This repository contains a collection of Matlab scripts and functions I wrote for the purpose of constructing 
surrogate models (SM) using uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques. These techniques I have not implemented myself
but they are taken from the UQ framework UQlab (www.uqlab.com).

The functions in this repo are meant to provide both a flexible and yet easy-to-use way to quickly produce a surrogate model
for regression problems.

So far (as of March 2019) the only technique used is sparse polynomial chaos expansion (SPCE).
